# Data Cleaning & Visualidsation - Movies Data

BRIEF DEACRIPTION:

I downloaded a big [Movies dataset](/DataSet/README.md) from kaggle, and I will perform data cleaning and pre-processing and some EDA, and do some Visualisation on the data, and see what insights I can extract from the data

In the **`Coding sessions`** folder, there jupyter notebook that articulate the data cealning process.
